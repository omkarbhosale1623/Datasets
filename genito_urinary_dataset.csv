Disease,Management,Common Pathogens
Bacterial Vaginosis,"Women with bacterial vaginosis are often asymptomatic. It is not usually necessary to treat bacterial vaginosis unless symptoms are present or an invasive procedure is planned, e.g. insertion of an IUD or termination of pregnancy. Treatment of male sexual contacts is not usually necessary.","Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococci, Mobilunculus, and others"
Chlamydia,"Advise avoidance of unprotected sexual intercourse for seven days after treatment has been initiated, and for at least seven days after any sexual contacts have been treated, to avoid reinfection. A test of cure should be done five weeks after initiation of treatment in pregnant women, if a non-standard treatment has been used, e.g. amoxicillin, or if symptoms do not resolve. Repeat STI screen in three months for patients with confirmed chlamydia.",Chlamydia trachomatis
Epididymo-orchitis,"Epididymo-orchitis may occur due to a variety of pathogens, but STI pathogens are more likely in males aged < 35 years, with a history of more than one sexual partner in the past 1-2 months, and urethral discharge. Test for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and UTI. Refer to hospital if symptoms are severe or if signs and symptoms do not resolve (or worsen) after 24 to 48 hours.","Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, E. coli, Bacteroides species, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Trichomonas vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and others"
Gonorrhoea,"Advise avoidance of unprotected sexual intercourse for seven days after treatment has been initiated, and for at least seven days after any sexual contacts have been treated, to avoid re-infection. A test of cure should be done five weeks after initiation of treatment in pregnant women. As co-infection with chlamydia is very common, azithromycin is also routinely given.",Neisseria gonorrhoeae
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID),"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is usually caused by an STI, particularly in women aged under 25 years, women who have had a recent change of sexual partner, or women with a previous history of gonorrhoea or chlamydia. Diagnosis of PID is clinical, taking into account the history, clinical findings, and results of tests. Women with severe PID and women who are pregnant require referral for specialist assessment. Hospital admission may be required for IV antibiotics.","Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and others"
Acute Pyelonephritis,"Only treat in the community if mild symptoms, e.g. low fever and no nausea or vomiting. If systemically unwell, dehydrated, or vomiting, refer to hospital for IV treatment. A urine culture and susceptibility test should be performed. Infants and children with pyelonephritis should be referred to hospital for treatment. Nitrofurantoin alone is not an appropriate choice for pyelonephritis as it fails to achieve tissue penetration. Oral trimethoprim might be used in a hospital setting after IV treatment.","Escherichia coli, Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus spp."
Trichomoniasis,"Advise avoidance of unprotected sexual intercourse for seven days after treatment has been initiated, and for at least seven days after any sexual contacts have been treated, to avoid re-infection. A test of cure is not usually required unless there is a risk of reexposure.",Trichomonas vaginalis
Acute Non-specific Urethritis,"Non-specific urethritis is a diagnosis of exclusion. A urethral swab and first void urine sample should be taken to exclude gonorrhoea and chlamydia (or use combination testing if available). Treat sexual contacts. Advise avoidance of unprotected sexual intercourse for seven days after treatment has been initiated, and for at least seven days after any sexual contacts have been treated, to avoid re-infection. Patients with symptoms persisting for more than two weeks, or with recurrence of symptoms, should be referred to a sexual health clinic or urologist.",Urethritis not attributable to Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis
Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) - Adult,"Antibiotic treatment is indicated for all people who are symptomatic. Asymptomatic bacteriuria requires antibiotic treatment in women who are pregnant but not in elderly women or patients with long-term indwelling urinary catheters. Non-pregnant females with uncomplicated UTI do not require a urine culture. However, urine culture is recommended in males, women who are pregnant, and those who fail to respond to empiric treatment within two days. Women who are pregnant should have repeat urine culture one to two weeks after completing treatment to ensure cure.","Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus spp."
Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) - Child,"Refer children aged under three months, those with severe illness, or those with recurrent infection, to hospital. Also consider referral of children aged under six months. Children aged over six months, without renal tract abnormalities, and who do not have acute pyelonephritis, may be treated with a short course (three days) of antibiotics. All children with suspected UTI should have a urine culture collected as a clean specimen (clean catch, catheter, midstream urine).","Escherichia coli, Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus spp."
